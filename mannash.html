        <p>Dear Mannat/Kachhua,</p>
        <p>hi mannat this is a very wierd way of approching someone to express thier feelings but yes.&nbsp;
        i hasnt been very well between us recently but i just want you to know i respect you.&nbsp;
        i am thankful to you for evrything you have done for me and i dont think anyone else&nbsp;
        would have done as much as you have done for me.&nbsp;
        i never realized it when things were good because i was in my own delusions that you'll leave.&nbsp;
        those delusions might be a little true but i&nbsp;
        know not everything you said and we did together&nbsp;
        was a lie. i know you liked it when i tied your <br>
        shoe laces or picked you up in my arms. <br>
        i know you liked it when i got you food.&nbsp;
        i know you liked watching things with me. <br>
        i know you like to hug me.&nbsp;
        i know you like to see my face. <br>
        you think i haven't caught you staring at my lips?&nbsp;
        its a hard time but we have always gotten&nbsp;
        through it together as a team. you're my bestfriend Mannat.&nbsp;
        I cant even thin about anyone lese when i think about having <br>
        a bestfriend (Rhythm Bhaiya might be an exception)&nbsp;
        but i cant think about anyone else when i close my eyes.&nbsp;
        its you. i want it to be you. no matter what.&nbsp;
        i wanna stop being so controlling. i wanna be with you.&nbsp;
        for as long i have air in my lungs and beyond.&nbsp;
        i love you Mannat Rajput.</p>
